# HeyYoBank - Practice Banking App

HeyYoBank is a practice banking app built using Python, Pandas, a database management system, and CSV files. It allows users to create an account, deposit money, and view their account balance. While the app currently operates on a simple command-line interface, there are plans for future additions, including a graphical user interface (GUI), integration with a more robust database management system, and the inclusion of analytics.
